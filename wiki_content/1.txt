== History ==
Ethan White was born in Adelaide, South Australia and resides in the town of Gawler, 40 kilometres north of Adelaide.Ethan has been passionate about filmmaking for most of his life. He stated that ever since he was a little boy, he loved filming with his family's digital video camera. Then, around the age of 11 years, Ethan's parents brought a camper trailer and Ethan immediately enjoyed the weekends and school holidays his family spent camping at locations in South Australia.During this time, Ethan mixed his two passions of filmmaking and travelling together, creating short family holiday videos that he would show to members of his family. As Ethan moved into high school, he realised that teenagers his age did not get the same opportunities he was so lucky to have.In November 2017, at the age of 15, Ethan contacted Channel 44 Adelaide, the community television station that services the Greater Adelaide region. Ethan proposed an idea for a travel-themed television program that encourages the younger generation to get outdoors with their families.
After discussions with the station, Ethan secured a program slot and formulated the title "Off the Couch with Ethan." In April 2018, filming for the first episode took place in the Southern Flinders Ranges in South Australia. The episode was broadcast on Saturday 23 June 2018 on Channel 44 Adelaide at 5:30pm, with great success and fantastic feedback from the general public.More Off the Couch with Ethan episodes continue to be produced and the program continues to be broadcast on Channel 44 Adelaide, as well as C31 Melbourne & Geelong, which began broadcasting the program in early 2019.A second season of the program was announced in November 2021, and is due to commence broadcasting in February 2022.
