== Approach Routes ==
Most climbers approach Crystal Peak from the east, in particular via the Crystal Lakes basin.  This approach, a pleasant hike, follows jeep trails until treeline and Lower Crystal Lake.  Four wheel drive vehicles can generally make it this far.  A trail on the north side of the lake takes climbers to Upper Crystal Lake, where gentle scree slopes provide access to the ridges north of the summit.
