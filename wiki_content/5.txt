The Country Club of Virginia is a private club in the Richmond, Virginia, area, with three eighteen-hole golf courses. 
CCV, which was organized in 1908, has always been one of the largest clubs in the country. Its 7,600+ members support 1,111 acres containing two clubhouses situated seven miles apart, 54 holes of golf, 24 tennis courts, five squash courts, three paddle tennis courts, an 85,000 square foot fitness facility, a state-of-the-art golf practice facility, five pools, multiple dining outlets, special event venues and more. 
The Country Club of Virginia offers three distinctly different golf courses designed by noted course architects Donald Ross, William Flynn, and Joe Lee. The celebrated James River Course has hosted numerous championships including the Southern Amateur Championship and the 1955 and 1975 National U.S. Amateur Championships. It also serves as the host site of the Dominion Energy Charity Classic, the first of three Charles Schwab Cup playoff events at the conclusion of the season on the PGA TOUR Champions. In 2016, 2017, and 2019 the tournament was recognized as the winner of the PGA TOUR Champions Players Award, which is selected by the golf professionals as a result of the excellent course and exceptional hospitality provided by members and staff. Three wins in four years by one tournament was previously unprecedented in PGA TOUR history.
