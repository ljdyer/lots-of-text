== Critical reception ==
Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger said the song is "resoundingly meh" with "a thoroughly OK production with some grating vocals" from k-os, and then favors another new track from Singles 93–03, "The Golden Path." In complete contrast, David Medsker from PopMatters prefer the song over "The Golden Path", called it their "first real hip-hop track" that "demands its listeners to drop and do the worm." He also stated: "[...] There’s something about the key, a combination of a major note and its sharp, that sticks in the craw. This will sound very cool in the clubs." musicOMH's Jamie Harper said the song "goes into new territory, as [the duo] invite Canadian rapper K-OS to MC over their creation."A new version of the song appeared on their live album Don't Think received a positive feedback from Nate Patrin of Pitchfork Media, he stated: "It all flows so smoothly so immediately that tracks which felt like late-career missteps on album-- like overstuffed pigeon-toed funk oddities like "Do It Again" and "Get Yourself High", which show up in succession in the set's first 10 minutes—come across as all-hook monsters, fused in a way that splits the difference and shaves off all the fat."


== Music video ==

The song's music video was directed by Joseph Kahn, and consisted of digitally manipulated footage from the 1980 Hong Kongese martial arts film 2 Champions of Shaolin.

I edited this on a laptop on a plane to Chicago. I rearranged the time sequencing of the actual movie. The bad guy with the big boombox is actually a minor henchman who dies in the first 30 minutes, but in my visual remix he’s the ultimate antagonist. The lip syncing was motion captured, then applied to 3D models of jaws. I didn’t know 100% if the technology was achievable with the time and money, nor did I know if we could actually get rights to a Chinese kung fu flick. It was a risky venture, but Carole gave me a check and then left me alone. She had some major balls.
Ashley Ringrose from Smashing Magazine listed the video at number 32 for his list of "60 Beautiful Music Videos."
